/**
 * In addition to the coroutine scope provided by different builders, it is possible to declare your own scope using the coroutineScope builder.
 * It creates a coroutine scope and does not complete until all launched children complete.
 *
 * runBlocking and coroutineScope may look similar because they both wait for their body and all its children to complete.
 * The main difference is that the runBlocking method blocks the current thread for waiting, while coroutineScope just suspends, releasing the underlying thread for other usages.
 * Because of that difference, runBlocking is a regular function and coroutineScope is a suspending function.
